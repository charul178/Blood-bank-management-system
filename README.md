The Blood Bank Management System is a web-based application built using Django and MySQL to streamline the process of blood donation and request management. It allows donors to register, update profiles, and track their donation history, while requesters can easily submit blood requests and check availability in real time. Admins can manage users, approve requests, and monitor blood inventory through a secure, role-based dashboard. The system ensures data privacy, automates notifications, and provides insightful reports to improve planning and efficiency. By reducing manual errors and improving response times during emergencies, this platform aims to modernize traditional blood bank operations and save lives through faster, more reliable service.
