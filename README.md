Acne is a widespread skin condition that significantly impacts both physical appearance and mental well-being, especially among adolescents and young adults. Traditional diagnosis methods rely heavily on visual inspection, which can be subjective and resource-constrained.

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the detection and classification of acne lesions from facial images. By leveraging deep learning, we aim to provide a scalable, accurate, and accessible solution that supports dermatological diagnosis, particularly in underserved areas.

The research includes a review of key methodologies, datasets, preprocessing techniques, CNN architectures, evaluation metrics, and real-world applications. It addresses challenges such as dataset bias and model interpretability, while proposing future directions for AI-powered dermatology.
